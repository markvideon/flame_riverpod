// `ref.watch`
// Watch stores a provider subscription if it is not already stored
// Reads for the latest value, sets up a listener to markNeedBuild.
//
// This works in conjunction with the build method which clears all the listeners before build
// executes.

// flame_riverpod v2
// A more sophisticated relationship / more control over when listeners are removed / added is a
// desirable outcome from using the flame_riverpod library, and v1 accomplishes this goal (with
// some drawbacks)
//
// [HasComponentRef] tracks the provider subscriptions associated on a specific Component, and
// cleans this local state up in onRemove. However, references in the parent ConsumerStatefulWidget
// / ConsumerWidget are still present and not removed until the next time that build is called.
